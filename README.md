IoT weather station using Node MCU

In this project we have built a weather station with Node MCU and different sensors like DHT11 and BMP180 sensor. All these sensors are connected to an Arduino.

This IoT-based weather station is specifically designed to facilitate the reporting of weather parameters over the Internet. This is one of the best IoT projects where the system is embedded with temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors that can monitor the weather conditions and provide live reports of weather statistics over a webserver.The weather data is updated live on the online webserver. So, you can directly check the weather stats online without having to rely on the reports of weather forecasting agencies.
